ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Hien!


ðŸŒŸ A bit about me: Passionate about Artificial Intelligence, I find myself most at home diving into the realms of self-hosted LLMs, NLP, and Machine Learning.


ðŸŽ“ My Background: After cutting my teeth in Applied CS at WUST, I've been on a thrilling journey through various facets of AI. Along the way, I've gathered experiences and stories working on a IAFF (Intelligent Assistant For Foreigners) project.


ðŸ”§ Tools of the Trade: My ML tech stack includes favorites like Langchain, Vector Stores (Chroma, FAISS, Pinecone). For web stack, I have been using Reactjs with Tailwind css, Python FastAPI, Node express with Apache server (for Reverse Proxy).


ðŸ“¬ Let's Connect: If you're interested in chatting about open-source LLMs, brainstorming on a project, or just want to say hi, feel free to drop a message. You can also find me on my social media sites on the left.
