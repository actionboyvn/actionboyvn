ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Hien!
ðŸŒŸ A bit about me: Passionate about Artificial Intelligence, I find myself most at home diving into the realms of self-hosted Large Language Models, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning. I'm a firm believer in the transformative power of AI, especially when combined with the spirit of open-source collaboration.
ðŸŽ“ My Background: After cutting my teeth in Applied CS at WUST, I've been on a thrilling journey through various facets of AI. Along the way, I've gathered experiences and stories working on a IAFF (Intelligent Assistant For Foreigners) project.
ðŸš€ What I'm up to: These days, you'll find me deeply engrossed in the world of self-hosted LLMs, figuring out how to tailor them for specific needs while keeping ethical considerations front and center. I'm also constantly tinkering with NLP projects, always curious about how far we can push the boundaries of machine understanding of human language.
ðŸ”§ Tools of the Trade: My tech arsenal includes favorites like Langchain, Vector Stores (Chroma, FAISS, Pinecone). I'm always on the lookout for new tools and techniques to add to my repertoire.
ðŸŒ± Always Learning, Always Sharing: I love the journey of learning and believe in growing together with the community. I'm all ears for exciting collaborations, thought-provoking discussions, or even just a casual chat about the ever-evolving world of AI.
ðŸ“¬ Let's Connect: If you're interested in chatting about AI, brainstorming on a project, or just want to say hi, feel free to drop a message. You can also find me on my social media sites on the left.
